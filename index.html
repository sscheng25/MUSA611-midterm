          Introduction to National Parks

        <p class="sec1-content">National parks are defined as a reserve of natural, semi-natural, 
        or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns, with the conservation of 
        ‘wild nature’ for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.</p>

        <p class="sec1-content">Since 1872 that the US government established the first “public park or pleasuring-ground 
        for the benefit and enjoyment of the people”, Yellowstone National Park, there has been 423 
        recreational sites in the National Park System (NPS), while about 60 of those are what 
        we often called national parks. During the past 150 years, over 15 billion visitors are 
        fascinated by the natural beauty of those parks and we really treasure those gifts from 
        our mother nature.</p>

            In 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant. 
            It was also the world's first national park. Thus, we can say that there is a history of 
            150 years for US national parks.

          <p class="slide-content">In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act,

            natural or historic interest on public lands.</p>
             
          <p class="slide-content"></p>The National Park Service was officially established in 1916.
